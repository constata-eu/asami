"""
  128 bit representation of a fixed-precision decimal number.

  The finite set of values of `Decimal` scalar are of the form
  m / 10<sup>e</sup>, where m is an integer such that
  -2<sup>96</sup> < m < 2<sup>96</sup>, and e is an integer between 0 and 28
  inclusive.

  Always serializes as `String`. But may be deserialized from `Int` and
  `Float` values too. It's not recommended to deserialize from a `Float`
  directly, as the floating point representation may be unexpected.
