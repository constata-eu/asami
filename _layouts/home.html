      <h2>Autonomous Social Ads Marketplace Initiative</h2>

      <p>Self Sovereign Social Networks ‚Äì like nostr or bluesky ‚Äì give freedom and power back to the community.</p>

      <p>They almost erase the role of the ‚Äúsocial media platform‚Äù.</p>

      <p>You can choose your own client software, servers, only read who you want to read ‚Äì and never see an ad.</p>

      <p>But ads are still a content creator‚Äôs main revenue stream, and may remain so in the future.</p>

      <p>Companies and projects will always be interested in leveraging influencer‚Äôs attention.</p>

      <p>And the general audience that pays for content with their attention would like less intrusive ads.</p>

      <p>Moreso, if ads were truly relevant and chosen by content creators, they may even find them useful.</p>

      <p>TV ads are annoying, but sport team fans wear their team‚Äôs shirt and sponsorships with pride.</p>

      <video controls src="https://github.com/constata-eu/bitcoin-scaling-hackathon/raw/main/nostr_ads_powered_by_rsk/rsk-nostr.mp4" width="100%"></video>

      <h1 class="lead">The centralized ads platform is replaced by self sovereign tools.</h1>

      <h3 id="an-escrow-service-between-brands-and-content-creators">An escrow service between brands and content creators.</h3>

      <p>The social media platform charges brands to serve their ads, and <em>may</em> pay content creators ‚Äì We are replacing that with a smart contract in RSK.</p>

      <p>
        In SSSNetworks like NOSTR, you can prove publication of a message to a smart contract.
        RSK is relatively cheap for this use case, and features the most resilient and decentralized stablecoin: Dollar on Chain.
      </p>

      <h4>Status</h4>
      <p>
        On track to staging before september.
        Verifying a nostr message costs 4 USD in fees which renders smaller campaigns useless. We‚Äôre exploring optimizing the cryptographic verification routines or making proof verification optional.
      </p>

      <h3 id="a-marketplace-of-brands-and-content-creators">A marketplace of brands and content creators.</h3>

      <p>A social media platform gets their cut from charging brands and paying content creators.</p>

      <p>
        They never meet, which affects the ad's relevance and effectiveness ‚Äì
        When content creators and brands meet for collaborations they are usually genuine and better received.
      </p>

      <p>We want to help them find each other, so we‚Äôre reaching out to brands and content creators to run a pilot program in nostr.</p>

      <p>We‚Äôre also building a chat bot were a brand representative can set up a new campaign and select relevant content creators, all as part of a chat session.</p>

      <p>
        The chatbot will also update the brand with some stats on the campaign and onboard content creators into the program,
        offer them collaboration opportunities and help them submit their proof and receive payment.
      </p>

      <h4>Status</h4>
      <p>
        We only have RSK as the interested brand yet, but seems reasonable we'll find more. It's hard to find influencers, so the the pilot program has not started yet.
        Chatbot architecture is defined and feasibility is confirmed, but implementation will start after the smart contract is done.
      </p>

      <h3 id="a-sssnetwork-analizer-for-reach-assesment-and-campaign-monitoring">Social graph analizer, for reach assesment and monitoring.</h3>

      <p>
        The social media platform knows exactly how many impressions an ad gets, and how many subscribers a content creator has
        Both brands and content creators trust this data to be correct.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the SSSNetwork model impressions cannot be reliably counted, and just like traditional social media,
        subscriber counts may be inflated by bots.
      </p>

      <p>To make campaigns fair, we need to know which users are bots and which content creators have the most reach.</p>

      <p>So we‚Äôre indexing the entirety of the nostr network to perform social graph analysis.</p>

      <h4>Status</h4>

      <p>
        The indexer is mostly done, running and indexed 45gb of nostr messages from public relays ‚Äì thats over a third of the network.
        We need to start including paid relays as well.
        The initial reach assesment and bot filtering algorithms have been defined and we will start implementing them soon.
