# Global branch quick ToDo:
- No need to track which request created which object yet, it's expensive in the contract, more complex, and not needed.
- Sync rows from events, store the event metadata (txhash ?)
- Set requests as done in bulk through their shared on-chain-tx relationship.
- (We can associate them later with the current heuristics using tx and specific shared data between request and final entity).

- implement AuditableModel and implement for models.
- Implement handle data updates and other periodic tasks.
- adminSetPrice and adminSetScoreAndTopics should be batcheable.
