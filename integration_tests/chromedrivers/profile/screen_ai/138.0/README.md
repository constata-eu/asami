# Chrome Screen AI Library

## Purpose
Chrome Screen AI library provides two on-device functionalities for Chrome and
ChromeOS:
* **Main Content Extraction:** Intelligently isolates the main content of a web
   page, improving its readability by stripping distracting elements (based on
   the accessibility tree).
* **Optical Character Recognition:** Extracts text from image.

These functionalities are entirely on device and do not send any data to
network or store on disk.
