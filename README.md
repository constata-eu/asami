# Ads for SSSN (Self Sovereign Social Networks)

We recognized the limitations and challenges of the traditional, centralized messaging systems in managing and implementing advertisements. In today's age of big data, information holds immense value, and the centralization of data by platforms often leads to biased control, disadvantaging both small and medium advertisers and the content received by the public. That's why we propose a **Public Reward System**

We plan to use transparent market mechanisms to drive attention where it's most valuable and build a decentralized ad network. Every individual has the opportunity to promote their content by compensating peers for posting, liking, or reposting.

**Influencers** are empowered to **act as advertisers**, offering a range of promotional options. They have the **liberty to choose** which products receive the spotlight and determine their level of involvement in ad campaigns. By making the rewards they receive public, we aim to foster accountability for the advertising choices they make.

## Implementation

Our objective is to develop advanced tools that enable transparent and automated advertising campaigns on _**SSSN**_ (Self Sovereign Social Networks). To achieve this, we will utilize smart contracts, ensuring **fair compensation** for users' participation and making sure advertisers pay solely for the publicity they receive.

The toolset will include an open appraisal algorithm and database, which will assess the value of a user's account within the _**SSSN**_. Additionally, we'll provide backoffice tools for advertisers and a chatbot interface for seamless communication between advertisers and users.

While initially considering the **Nostr** protocol, we are now focusing on making it adaptable and scalable to integrate with various emerging **Self Sovereign Social Networks**.

For the smart contract platform, we have opted for **RSK**. Utilizing well-established units of account like **RBTC** and **DOC stablecoin** will instill certainty when budgeting and assessing liquidity or cash-out options.

Our **innovative "appraisal" algorithm** will effectively map and weigh the entire _**SSSN**_ social graph. This kind of large dataset is costly to build and maintain, and can possibly be rented out in several ways to continue funding the project.

This project marks the initial stage of a deeper integration between **Nostr** and **RSK**. Ultimately, our goal is to build a bridge that **allows** decentralized network **users**, across all emerging SSSNs, to **interact with RSK** using natural language messages, reducing reliance on centralized http and browsers.
